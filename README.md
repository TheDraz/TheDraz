# Welcome to my Github page

## About me

- I'm a hobby developer who codes in his free time and is interested in all things tech
- My main interest at the moment are general software tools. I was really into game development a few years back, but that got put on the back burner for now (linked my itch.io page if you want to play any of my games)

- Other interests include **Linux**, **Art** and **Gaming**
